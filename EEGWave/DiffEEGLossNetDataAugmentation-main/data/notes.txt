Dataset Description
BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a (BCIC4D2a)
The BCIC4D2a dataset consists of EEG signals recorded from 9 participants during motor imagery tasks. Participants were instructed to imagine the movements of their left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue after an instructional cue appeared on the screen.

Recording Details:
EEG signals were recorded from 22 channels based on the international 10-20 system. In addition, 3 EOG channels were included to detect ocular artifacts. The signals were sampled at 250 Hz and pre-processed using a band-pass filter with a range of 0.5 - 100 Hz. To further reduce interference, a notch filter at 50 Hz was applied to suppress line noise.
Preprocessing:
For this work, we band-pass filtered the EEG signals between 4 and 38 Hz using a zero-phase filter. The data were down-sampled to 128 Hz. Epochs were extracted within the time window of [0.5, 4] seconds after the onset of the cue. The signals were normalized by subtracting the channel-wise mean and dividing by the standard deviation to constrain the values within the range [-1, 1]. Any trials marked as artifacts by the dataset publishers were excluded from the analysis.
BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b (BCIC4D2b)
The BCIC4D2b dataset provides EEG data from 9 participants performing binary motor imagery tasks. In this task, participants were required to imagine the movements of their left or right hand based on visual instructions.

Recording Details:
EEG signals were recorded using three bipolar channels (C3, Cz, and C4) in accordance with the international 10-20 system. The data were sampled at 250 Hz, and signals were band-pass filtered within the range of 0.5 - 100 Hz. Additionally, a 50 Hz notch filter was applied to suppress line noise artifacts.
Preprocessing:
For consistency, we applied a band-pass filter between 4 and 38 Hz using a zero-phase filter and down-sampled the signals to 128 Hz. Epochs corresponding to the time window [0.5, 2.5] seconds after the onset of the cue were extracted. The extracted epochs were normalized via channel-wise mean subtraction and standard deviation division to ensure the data values lie within the range [-1, 1]. Predefined artifact trials identified by the dataset publishers were excluded from the study.
