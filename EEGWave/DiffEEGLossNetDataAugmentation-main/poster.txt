Data
Brain Signal: EEG signals from motor imagery tasks (image example of EEG signals)
Task: EEG Signal Classification
Problem: Need for additional data to enhance performance
Solution: Data augmentation using generative modeling
Approach: Leveraging diffusion models for high-quality EEG data generation
Proposed Model: DiffEEGLossNet
EEG Signal Feature Extraction

Classification model: EEGNet (diagram illustrating EEGNet structure)
Generative Model

Variational Diffusion Model:
Trained with 1000+ diffusion steps (include graphical model of DDIM, Fig. 1 from paper)
Distillation for Fast Sampling:
Accelerates diffusion process to 4 steps or even a single step.
Results
Data Augmentation Effectiveness:

Section 5.2: Accuracy comparison tables from EEGNet and EEGProgress with augmented data (two key tables)
Motor Imagery Loss Analysis:

Conclusions
The proposed DiffEEGLossNet achieves state-of-the-art EEG data generation and augmentation for EEG classification tasks.
Significant improvements in classification accuracy are demonstrated using augmented data from the generative model.
The distillation method greatly reduces sampling time without compromising data quality.
